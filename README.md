The following is overview of the project:

1. Data Source and Collection: The dataset used for this project was sourced from a reputable provider, the hospital Platinum, ensuring data quality and reliability. The dataset consists of ECG recordings sampled at a frequency of 500 Hz, each lasting for a 10-second duration, resulting in 5000 data points per recording.
2. Data Labeling: To create a supervised learning problem, diagnostic data was used to meticulously label the ECG waveforms. This labeling process involved categorizing each recording as 'normal' or 'abnormal' based on medical expertise and reference standards.

3. Data Preprocessing (Normalization): Data preprocessing is a crucial step to ensure the model's effectiveness. Normalization was applied to the dataset, which typically involves scaling the data to a standardized range, often [0, 1]. This ensures that all features are on a consistent scale, which is particularly important for machine learning algorithms that rely on numerical values.

4. Machine Learning Algorithm Selection (Random Forest): Random Forest was chosen as the machine learning algorithm for classification. The justification for this choice might be based on its ensemble learning capabilities, ability to handle complex, high-dimensional data, and the availability of feature importance scores, which are valuable for understanding the significance of specific ECG features in the classification process.

5. Model Training: The labeled and preprocessed dataset is used to train the Random Forest model. During training, the algorithm learns to identify patterns and features that distinguish normal and abnormal ECG waveforms.

6. Model Evaluation: To assess the model's performance, two evaluation techniques are employed:
• Classification Report: This provides detailed metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and support for both 'normal' and 'abnormal' classes. It gives insights into how well the model is performing for each class.
• Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix helps in visualizing the model's predictions and comparing them with the actual class labels. It displays true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
